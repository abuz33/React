> Make sure you're building on last week's codebase.

The main additions you'll add this week is to (1) keep adding to the list of already searched cities and (2) allow users to remove a city from previous search result.

### 1. Requirements

By the end of this week's assignment your application should look similar to this:

![Week 3 Wireframe](../assets/project/week3.png)

Here are the requirements your project needs to fulfill:

- Any time a user searches for a new city, add it to a list of already searched cities
- Allow a user to delete a search entry, by clicking the "X"
- Only allow a user to use the "Search City" button when the input field has at least 1 character
- Redploy your site

Hints:

- Think about what data structure makes most sense to use
- Make use of `filter()` when removing cities
